**A virtual assistant for learning Mathematics**

This web application allows students to learn concepts in Mathematics, take a test, get results, and receive insights into their performance. At each point of the process, the student can use the virtual assistant (chat-bot) for assistance.

This version covers the topic of probability for the International Baccalaureate Board.

## How it works

**Adaptive learning module**
- Constructs a knowledge graph of the student and constantly updates it as the student takes a test or learns a concept.<br>
*(A knowledge graph denotes how well each concept asked in a question is known by the student)*
  
**Chat bot module**
- Returns answers from a set of answers based on the student's knowledge graph.
- Also suggests questions at different points based on the knowledge graph.
